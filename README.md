Household Power Consumption Prediction

This project predicts household electricity load using high-dimensional meter readings. We perform EDA, apply dimensionality reduction, and train regression models to evaluate how model performance changes with feature reduction.

Steps

Load and clean the dataset

Run EDA (histograms, summary stats, pairplot, correlations)

Apply dimensionality reduction

Train baseline Linear Regression

Train Gradient Boosting on reduced features

Compare RMSE
